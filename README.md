The app is intended to be a [sandbox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_%28software_development%29) promoting group member *particiation* in best practices in state-of-the-art project design, coding and code project management for the [Tacoma-JS meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tacoma-JS/).  It is expected that members will suggest and implement features as part of personal growth in their topic interest area.  See additional documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/Tacoma-JS/weatherapp/wiki).
